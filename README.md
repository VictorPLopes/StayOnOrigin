# StayOnOrigin+
Forked from [StayOnOrigin](https://github.com/Dyvinia/StayOnOrigin), developed by [Dyvinia](https://twitter.com/Dyvinia) and I.
All credits for the idea and creation of the app go to her, and this fork only exists to make some "personal" changes to the program without interfering with Dyvinia's project.

## Changes from StayOnOrigin
* Downloads the right version of Origin, if no other version is installed (no need to downgrade from the latest version)
* Includes option to enable [Origin's hidden R&D mode](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Store:Origin#Origin_stops_downloading_after_an_ungiven_threshold), which has been reported to improve download speeds/stability
* Includes option to open Origin after running the program
* Updated code

## Features
As of now, EA is forcing Origin users to "upgrade" to the EA App and uninstall Origin, which lacks many of the features from the old app, and is not as stable. This program restores a previous version of Origin from before the forced migration and "patches" it to never update to the EA App.
StayOnOrigin+ also allows Origin's hidden Research and Development mode to be enabled for better download performance.

## How to Use
Firstly, download the [latest release](https://github.com/VictorPLopes/StayOnOriginPlus/releases) and run the exe (as admin). **You do not need to have Origin installed**.
Then, simply follow the instruction on-screen:
- If Origin is not installed, you will be prompted to install it. Simply press "Y" and the launcher will be downloaded. StayOnOrigin+ will resume after the install process is over.
- If the latest versions of Origin are installed, the app will downgrade it to an usable version.
- When the app finds the right version of Origin, it will automatically disable the forced updates and edit the config files.
- After Origin has been patched, you will be prompted to enable the R&D mode. This is 100% optional, but enabling it has been reported to improve game downloads.
- At last, StayOnOrigin+ will ask if you wish to launch Origin.
